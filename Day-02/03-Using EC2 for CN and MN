1. Connect to the Control Node
   ssh -i your_private_key.pem ubuntu@<control_node_public_ip>
2. Install Ansible on the Control Node
  Update the package lists:
    sudo apt update
  Install Ansible:
    sudo apt install ansible
3. Configure SSH Key-Based Authentication
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ""
   Copy the public key to the managed node. Replace <managed_node_public_ip> with the actual IP address:
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@<managed_node_public_ip>
    (above command keep throwing error: permssion denied(publickey)
4. Workaround(Manual Copy)
  On the control node, display the public key:
    vim ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  Copy the entire output, which should start with ssh-rsa and end with your username and hostname
  Edit the authorized_keys file in manage node
    vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  First click 'i' and Paste the public key you copied into this file and click'Esc' and ':wq' for save and exit 
  Now try to connect with Manage node server using ssh ubuntu@managenode-IP
